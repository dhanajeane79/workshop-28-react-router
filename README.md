# React Router Workshop: Simple Color Navigation

In this workshop, we'll be using React Router, a powerful library for handling routing in React applications. By setting up routes and their corresponding components, we'll enable navigation and rendering different parts of our application based on the URL.

The final result will be a straightforward application with two routes, "blue" and "red". Clicking on the links for these routes will change the URL and render a component with the background color corresponding to the selected route.
